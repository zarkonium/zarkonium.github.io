###### This course is the last in a series of first-year technology mathematics courses that provide students with a sound pre-calculus mathematical background. While operations with exponents and radicals are thoroughly covered, a major portion of the course is devoted to algebraic methods of solution of various types of equations including quadratic, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic and those which contain radicals. The applications of mathematical concepts and methods of solving a variety of typical scientific and technical problems are also emphasized.
