The Oral Dental Exam is part of the [Connect2D Dentistry](https://connect2dteledentistry.com/) suite of services, capable of detecting a host of dental diseases such as gingivitis, gum recession and calculus from a selfie, in order to assist clients to self diagnose any hygenic issues. The results of the model aid dental offices in booking appropriate appointments and suggest home remedies.
