Using Domain Randomization, we generate the LIAM-LF-Dataset, made up of 20,000 light fields with 9x9 angular and 512x512 spatial resolution respectively. The light fields also include a depth map and a segmentation map as observed from the central subaperature image. A part of the dataset is made available for research purposes and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zarkonium/liam-light-field-dataset).
