Using Domain Randomization, we generate the LIAM-LF-Dataset, made up of 20,000 light fields with 9x9 angular and 512x512 spatial resolution respectively. The light fields also include a depth map and a segmentation map as observed from the central subaperature image. Data is available on request for research purposes.
