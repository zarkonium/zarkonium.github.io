Utilizing pose estimation models, we successfully built a realtime exercise rep counter, light enough to be run on a mobile device. We are able to identify dozens of different exercises, and provide visual indicators if any bad form is detected. The project is part of the [FITFI](https://www.fitfi.ai/) fitness platform, available FREE on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1479768845).
