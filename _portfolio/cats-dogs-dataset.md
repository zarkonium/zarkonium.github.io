Using Domain Randomization, we synthesize 10,000 cat and 10,000 dog images, across a variety of poses, breeds, camera angles, lighting conditions, occluders and textures. The dataset also features 2,500 car and 2,500 bike images, generated in a similar fashion, minus the occluders. The dataset is publically available for research purposes and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zarkonium/synthetic-image-dataset-cats-dogs-bikes-cars).

The dataset is the focus of the paper [Domain Randomization for Neural Network Classification](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-021-00455-5). If you use the dataset, please cite the publication using the following:
